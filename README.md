      <h2>Business Pitch</h2>
      <p> Checking up on patients during the 90 day post-surgery period is becoming increasingly difficult and costly due to a lack of communication, funds, and hospital staff. That’s where we come in, introducing our app, Mobile Medic, a curative assistant at your fingertips. Mobile Medic works to improve communication between health-care providers and patients and reduce the expense and progression of post-surgical complications. Unlike other apps, our simple design caters to older patients and quickly connects them to doctors and online assistants when post-surgical complications are detected. Tanvi, Jane, Marcus, Yiwei, and Tanisha are very excited to show you our creation. Mobile Medic is revolutionizing medical technologies and helping post-surgical patients live longer, healthier lives. 
</p>
      <h2>Our Goals</h2>
      <p>
      <li>Provide safe rehabilitation for patients with serious surgery.</li>
      <li> Reduce the number of patients in the overcrowded hospital and rehabilitation centers.</li>
      <li> Bring quality and efficient information to patients who are in need and get them in contact with a doctor if necessary. </li>
      </p>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
      In 2016, nearly 800 hospitals throughout the US have been slowly overwhelmed as they are unable to take care of patients following serious/extensive procedures/operations (such as joint replacements, heart surgeries, and the like), as a result of which, many individuals are not receiving the critical post-operative care they need in this most important of times [2]. The post-care model is geared more towards the older adults who have a decreased physiological reserve and take longer to recover from illness as 85% of patients are 65+ [3]. Previous research found that as many as 25%–35% of older adults lose at least one activity of daily living (ADL) following 10–14 days of hospitalization for acute illness [4]. Despite the increasing number of people who undergo such procedures due to the rising elderly population, hospitals are unable to keep up with the demand for care and support staff - this is also due, in part, to the lack of funding - it is estimated that Medicare spends upwards of $40 Billion are spent annually for readmissions [5]. One study estimated that 80 percent of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during the hand-off between medical providers. - this might be of use for a solution: better training for more effective communication [5].

Current solutions, such as telemonitoring techniques and remote care, are reliant on technology and may fail to deliver adequate care when necessary in the event of an emergency. Further to this, many elderly individuals are not quite as adept at complex technology. A new model is needed, to take better care of patients immediately following such methods and to compensate for the issues brought about by older adults. Any revised model must take into account the aging user base, and must thus be adaptable, accessible, and accurate: able to provide care of various types to an ailing population and to allow for autonomy and increase the effectiveness in delivering care and ensuring long-term benefits [7]. Our ultimate goal is to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution to increase the opportunities of treatment at Medicare while maintaining on budget.

<h2>Our Stakeholders</h2>
<p>
<li><b>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) [1]:</b> Legal [OPC enforces the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which outlines the privacy obligations most private sector organizations have to follow when managing personal information throughout the duration of their activities. For federally regulated organizations, PIPEDA is used for the personal information of employees and job applicants].</li>
<li><b>Doctors and Patients: </b> Social [The possibility of solving problems online instead of waiting in line at the hospital makes the lives of both the doctor and the patient simpler]. </li>
<li><b>Insurance [1]:</b> Economic [By reducing the post-surgery complications and therefore expenses, insurance companies will not have to cover high expenses. This could reduce the income insurance companies earn, but would save patients money]. </li>
<li><b>Hospitals [8]:</b> Economic/Social [Since the app is projected to save both hospitals and patients money, the hospitals can use the money to upgrade their facilities (e.g. new machinery) or hire more employees/pay employees more, which could lead to economic growth. An increase in staff could further help with the issues regarding post-surgery complications as they will be more capable of looking after many patients]. </li>
<li><b>Cybersecurity Companies [9]:</b> Legal/Ethical [Since the app contains sensitive data (e.g. health card numbers, medical histories, personal information), the data must be protected, such as through cybersecurity companies. These security services have the responsibility to ensure that the data is safe and is used in an ethical manner (e.g. not sold for malicious purposes, preventive measures for hacking, keeping patient confidentiality, etc.)]. </li>
</p>
      
<h2>Our Service Environment</h2>
<p>
The service environment is on an electronic device for both ends (medical professionals and patients). Since the project is an app, it is used in an area where there is sufficient cell phone coverage (e.g, Wi-Fi, cellular data). The service environment currently only targets the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) but may expand beyond it. Hence, most of the patients should be in the GTA who have visited the hospitals, but other patients who are outside Ontario or Canada will eventually be able to access this app to contact their rehabilitation instructor or doctor. The service environment is mostly the patients who need to go to the rehabilitation centers as those injuries are more severe than in traditional hospitals. However, the patients of these hospitals (e.g. North York General Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital, etc.) should also be able to use this app for their recovery.
</p>

<h2>Functions, Objectives, and Constraints</h2>
<p> <b>Functions:</b> <br> 

<li> The project will reduce the progression of patient complications post-discharge in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). </li> 
<li> It should also help reduce the amount of patients in the rehab centers, so leaves space for the more severe patients. </li>
<li> The project will also reduce the necessity of going back to the hospital within the period of rehabilitation. </li>
</p>
<P>
<b>Objectives:</b> </br>
<li> The project’s interface should be accessible (e.g. take into consideration the needs of different populations such as the visually impaired or lack of technological experience). </li> <li> The terminology used should be descriptive and easy to understand for patients. </li>      
      </P>
      <P>
        <b>Constraints: </b>
<li> Must be legal within electronic privacy laws. </li>
<li> Must inform patients about their rehabilitation. </li>
<li> Must cost less than the money it is expected to save, ideally less than the money that the hospital will save in the next five years. </li>
      </P>
    
<h2>Social Determinants of Health</h2>
<p> Mobile Medic helps improve many of the issues relating to the social determinants of health in Canada. One of these social determinants of health is as follows: <li>
      <b>Employment and Working Conditions (#6): </b> According to Statistics Canada, in 2000, 35% of Canadian workers reported experiencing work-related stress from “too many demands or too many hours,” an increase of 7.5% since 1991. Additionally, in Canada, about 33% of men and 12% of women work more than 40 hours per week [10]. Evidently, many Canadian workers have limited time available for non-work related activities and the stress of medical concerns can build upon pre-existing stress. However, Mobile Medic decreases said stress and also saves workers time. Instead of needing to book appointments or rushing to a hospital, patients can use their app to complete a virtual check-up and be given next steps within a matter of minutes, saving a substantial amount of time that can be used for other activities instead. </li>
